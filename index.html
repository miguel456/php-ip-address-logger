<p>Log IP addresses simply without the need to check server logs; Useful for seeing who accessed a page at what time. This is a low interaction honeypot and you may set up multiple directores with several installations. Communication between them is a planned feature (See <a href="https://git.io/v6hjp" title="Releases">Releases</a> for a list of planned features + pre-releases) as well as URL reporting when multiple are installed.</p>

<p>This simple script will log someone's IP address upon visiting a page, to your database. <del>Can be repurposed to log something else by changing a few variables.</del></p>

<h1>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<p>Simply drag and drop the scripts to the directory you want to log. <del>Rename from index.php to something else if you already have one, and then make something of yours point there.</del> 
Then, import the SQL file to your database and fill in its login details in the config file.</p>

<a id="uses" class="anchor" href="#uses" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uses</h1>

<p>I originally created this as I was getting too many 404's to non-existent locations, such as phpMyAdmin or PMA. So, as there was no similar software to do this,
I decided to go ahead and write this, and set up an honeypot. This way, I know their address without going through thousands of entries in the log.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>If you want to, you can use this code as a base to log something; it's up to you.</p>

I don't even know if there are useful use cases other than an honeypot, and this may even be obsolete. I didn't find anything similar to use!</h2>

<p>More features are coming! Check out the latest release's release notes for them (That release has essentially the same source code as the main repo, which you are viewing).  </p>

<h1>
<a id="retrieving-the-badguys-addresses" class="anchor" href="#retrieving-the-badguys-addresses" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Retrieving the badguys' addresses</h1>

<p>Simply use your favorite SQL client and open the "addresses" table, and select the data. All the addresses that have hit the URL you rigged will be there, along with a detailed timestamp. </p>

<h1>
<a id="whitelisting-users" class="anchor" href="#whitelisting-users" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Whitelisting users</h1>

<p>To keep someone from having their address sent to the DB, simply insert their numerical IP into the "whitelist" table. Then the app will exit if it finds someone with an address inside "whitelist".</p>

<h1>
<a id="bugs-errors-or-feature-suggestionsimprovements" class="anchor" href="#bugs-errors-or-feature-suggestionsimprovements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bugs, errors or feature suggestions/improvements</h1>

<p>Report all bugs you find (Although I think there are none at the moment), leave suggestions or improvement requests in a ticket. You can also start a pull request for a new feature/improvement and I'll look into it.</p>

<h1>
<a id="security" class="anchor" href="#security" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Security</h1>

<p><del>Warning! The scripts create two files named addresses.txt and whitelist.txt. YOU MUST define a hidden segment in filtering rules (IIS Users) for both of them, or create a .htaccess file doing so (Apache users). Note that I DO NOT support Apache</del>
At the moment, there are no security concerns. There are, however, if you fail to fill in the db details.</p>
