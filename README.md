~~**I've decided to re-pick on this project and port it to OO, as well as fix some beginner-level mistakes.~~

** THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. DOWNLOAD AT OWN RISK. **

# PHP Compatibility
This program was developed and tested against PHP version 5.4.45. Any other versions are untested and the program may not work at all. If you whish to use this, please use only PHP version ```5.4.45```.

# Supported Webservers
- Pretty much everything that runs on Unix or Linux. WINDOWS IS NOT SUPPORTED.

# Broken features warning
The admin panel feature is currently non-function and unfinished. I recommend not using it until further notice.


# php-ip-address-logger
Log IP addresses simply without the need to check server logs; Useful for seeing who accessed a page at what time. This is a low interaction honeypot and you may set up multiple directores with several installations. Communication between them is a planned feature (See [Releases](https://git.io/v6hjp "Releases") for a list of planned features + pre-releases) as well as URL reporting when multiple are installed.

~~Quick note: Most of this project is PHP. The only HTML content here is the fake error pages and their translated counterparts, that's why HTML percentage is bigger than PHP's. Don't listen to GitHub's math!~~

This ~~simple~~ script will log someone's IP address upon visiting a page, to your database. ~~Can be repurposed to log something else by changing a few variables.~~

# Branches
Use of the web-interface branch is not supported as it is under constant development and there are things that are unfinished. Please use one of the releaeses or download from Master only.

# Installation

Simply drag and drop the scripts to the directory you want to log. ~~Rename from index.php to something else if you already have one, and then make something of yours point there.~~ 
Then, import the SQL file to your database and fill in its login details in the config file.
**IMPORTANT!** You must configure every line of the config.php file, otherwise the app **WILL** not work!

# Uses 
I originally created this as I was getting too many 404's to non-existent locations, such as phpMyAdmin or PMA. So, as there was no similar software to do this,
I decided to go ahead and write this, and set up an honeypot. This way, I know their address without going through thousands of entries in the log.


# Upcoming Features
- ~~Logging to MySQL~~ Done
- ~~Config file (Better Whitelisting System, fallback in case db fails)~~ Done
- ~~Interface for whitelisting addresses~~  ON HOLD
- ~~Add security support for apache (.htaccess)~~ Done, with MySQL support there is no need for a .htaccess 
- ~~Make script silently handle errors without letting end-user know (the fallback is the error handling)~~ Done
- ~~Grab HTTP Headers and referrers, and filter them~~ Done
- ~~Idiot Mode Done~~ REMOVED
-  ~~Add multi-language support for each error page (based on IP)~~ DONE
- Add web interface for easily whitelisting and "victim" retrieval, therefore not requiring technical knowledge.

More features are coming! Check out the latest release's release notes for them (That release has essentially the same source code as the main repo, which you are viewing).

# Retrieving the badguys' addresses
Simply use your favorite SQL client and open the "addresses" table, and select the data. All the addresses that have hit the URL you rigged will be there, along with a detailed timestamp. 

# Whitelisting users
To keep someone from having their address sent to the DB, simply insert their numerical IP into the "whitelist" table. Then the app will exit if it finds someone with an address inside "whitelist".

# Bugs, errors or feature suggestions/improvements
Report all bugs you find (Although I think there are none at the moment), leave suggestions or improvement requests in a ticket. You can also start a pull request for a new feature/improvement and I'll look into it.
